This project is a Work In Progress.

I am learning GO, and I am building a project to understand and execute the fundamentals in GO.

The functionality managed is basic, just standard CRUD operations for a TODO list applicaiton.

However, I want to apply as many backend concepts and GO constructs in the project as feasible, such as goroutines, channels, mutexes, caching, etc.
